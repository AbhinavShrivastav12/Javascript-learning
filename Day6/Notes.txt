# While making the gusessing thing from the machine either it is for rock-paper-sissor or  ludo or any other game there is a simple tactic. 
# Just use Math.random() javascript built in function that return the number between 0 and 1 but not exactly to be more precise.
# So now we have 3 things [rock. paper, sissor] and have 0 to 1 line number.
# Just bisect the line like from 0 to 1/3 is Rock and from 1/3 to 2/3 is Paper and from 2/3 to 1 is Sissor
