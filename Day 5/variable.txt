1. What is variable?
-- A variable is a container which stores number and string in it and then we can use the value.
2. Syntax rule for the variable
-- The word let create a new variable
-- Cannot use special words to create a variable. Like let, var, etc. these are reserved words in javascript. example let let = 3;
-- Cannot start with the number: let 2hey = 'hello';
-- Cannot use special characters except: $... like let name@! = 4; or let name two = 5;
-- However we can use $ and _ for creating a variable. like let $let = 4; or let _he = 5;
-- Assigning the value to variable 
[example: let variable1 = 3; console.log(variable1); //3 ]
-- reassiging value to the variable
[example: variable! = 5; console.log(variable1); //5] -- here we don't use let because it already defined up
-- let means creating a new variable
-- In javascript for declaringa  variable name use camelcase [example: cartQuantity]
-Const also use to create the value of the variable but we can't change the value later. [example: const a =1;]
const make the code safer and easier to understand.
--var is also used to create the variable just like let we can change the value later.
-- var is the original way to create a variable [ var = variable]

- camelCase = cartQuantity [first word first letter small and second word first letter is capital]
- PascalCase = CartQuantity [first word first letter capital and second word first letter is also capital]
- kebab-case = cart-quantity [- between the words]
- snake_case = cart_qunatity [ _ between the words]
